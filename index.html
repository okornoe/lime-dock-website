                        The Vivo Energy story is an African story – one of robust demographic trends
                        driving dynamic and sustained growth, in a continent on the move.
                        Our business brings together the power of one of the world’s great brands
                        and the flexibility of a vibrant, entrepreneurial corporate culture.
                        All set against the backdrop of surging demand in one of the world’s
                        fastest-growing regions.

                        Established in 2011, Vivo Energy is the company behind the Shell brand,
                        and now also the Engen brand, in multiple African markets.

                        Total’s operations in Ghana have spanned over 65 years.
                        The Company made its first entry into Ghana as Total Oil Products.
                        Total, since then, has undergone various transformations.
                        Total took over the British Petroleum through Elf Oil and French TotalFinaElf.
                        This was followed by a global merger of Total and Elf;
                        and ultimately the incorporation of Total Petroleum Ghana PLC when
                        Total Outre-Mer acquired Mobil in Ghana.
                        This progression, coupled with great respect for quality, standards,
                        achievements, and safety has propelled the Company to the forefront of the
                        Industry.

                        Total has a strong brand image in the Ghanaian market.
                        The Company is well represented in all 16 Regions of the country
                        with strategic locations in major cities and towns.
